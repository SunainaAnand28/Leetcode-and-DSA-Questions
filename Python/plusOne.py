#  https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/description/
# 
# You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.
# Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits. 


def plusOne(digits):
    n = len(digits)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if digits[i] < 9:
            digits[i] += 1
            return digits
        digits[i] = 0
    
    # If all digits are 9, we need an extra digit
    return [1] + digits
